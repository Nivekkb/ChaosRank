# Serenix Digital Landing Page

## Strategic direction
- **Goal:** Turn `serenixdigital.com` into the chaotic but confident parent brand that introduces ChaosRank and future mischief makers.
- **Voice:** Bold, provocative, cultured chaos—clear messaging but with nerdy disdain for polished corporate talk.
- **Primary CTA:** Email or jump to the domain to book a secretive demo.

## Content blueprint
1. **Hero:** Statement of identity, subheadline describing Serenix as parent company, CTA + domain callout, plus live-operating stack visual.
2. **Values:** “Why Serenix?” copy + promise list that highlights culture-first, glitch-loving products.
3. **Showcase:** Feature ChaosRank as flagship with three outcome cards (live ranking, AI mutations, reputation mechanics).
4. **Services:** Preview other capabilities (experiential launches, audience intelligence, guardian automation) to position as a studio.
5. **CTA block:** “Ready to debut?” message with email CTA and domain link.
6. **Footer:** Tagline, copyright, legal links.

## Design system
- **Color accents:** Neon magenta `#ff4dff`, electric green `#14f195`, charcoal backgrounds.
- **Typography:** Space Grotesk from Google Fonts with `font-display: swap`, uppercase hero copy with letter spacing.
- **Buttons:** 56px min height, 16px/32px padding, glowing shadows.
- **Panels:** Rounded corners (18-30px) with translucent overlays, soft blur/backdrop to mimic runway vibe.
- **Motion:** Pulse line cycles copy every 2.5s for liveliness.

## Launch instructions
1. **Hosting:** Deploy `serenix-digital/` to your hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, etc.). Point `https://serenixdigital.com` to that build and swap `og-serenix.png` with your final WebP asset.
2. **Integrations:** Keep the email CTA `mailto:hello@serenixdigital.com` for CRM collection; swap with a form when you have a concierge flow.
3. **Product linking:** Update the ChaosRank showcase copy with real URLs once the board is live (`https://chaosrank.app/live` or whichever route you publish). Add other product tiles as they are ready.
4. **Tracking:** Attach analytics (GA4/Segment) and heatmaps to monitor how visitors interact with the CTA and service highlights.
5. **Brand consistency:** Reuse the neon/glitch palette for other subsidiary pages and maintain the pulse messaging cycle for future launches.
